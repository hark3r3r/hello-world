# hello-world
I have no idea... 
I've been meaning to learn a little bit about what I'm doing in the lab I work at. Currently, I am stuck at the Denver Airport, totally sleep deprived and annoyed. I need to get a function or module for use in some of the codes that we use... I am an aerospace (or physics, we'll see) engineering major, trying to learn as much code as I can.

Python, Java, and Matlab are my main interests
sorry :D
